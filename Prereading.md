# Computer vision and applications

Before class make sure you have installed on your laptop:
- Python 3.9+
- OpenCV `pip install opencv-python`
- ONNX `pip install onnx`
- ONNX Runtime `pip install onnxruntime`
- Jupyter (optionally) `pip install jupyter`

If you feel confident with neural networks, you can also prepare environment for training one during practice 
(it won't be covered during the lecture and won't be mandatory for the practice):
- PyTorch `pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`
- Lightning `pip install lightning`
